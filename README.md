# Peaks
Experimenting with an algorithm challenge

Given an array of unsorted integers, create a function which finds number "peaks." A peak is defined as an index for which the adjacent (previous and next) index values are lesser than that index value. The function should log index and value to the console, as well as return an array of all peak values. Once a solution is found, optimize for execution time.
